## Usage
To use the Bookmarks data module, first decide if you want to use it on top of:
* @inrupt/solid-client
* rdflib-js (not implemented yet)
* soukai
* LDO (not implemented yet)

See the applicable subfolder

* If you're using `@inrupt/solid-client` you should pick `bookmarks/vanilla`.
* If you're using `soukai-solid` go ahead and pick `bookmarks/soukai`.
* as a rule of thumb, if you're new to solid and don't know which one to choose, pick the vanilla one.
