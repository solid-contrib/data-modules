Weekly meeting: Fridays 4pm-5pm Amsterdam time in https://meet.jit.si/solid-data-modules

## Data types covered
### _(coming soon)_
Data types for which we will produce Solid Data Modules:
* bookmarks
* chat
* contacts
* maps

## Paradigms covered
### _(coming soon)_
The "vanilla" version of each of these data modules will be usable in combination with just an
authenticated fetcher, such as [Solid Auth Fetcher](https://github.com/solid-contrib/solid-auth-fetcher),
or the fetcher from the [Inrupt JS Libs](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/authentication/).
Apart from this "vanilla" version, we will also package each data module for use in combination with the following client-side Solid app paradigms:
* [Soukai-Solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid)
* [rdflib](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js)
* [LDO](https://github.com/o-development/ldo)
